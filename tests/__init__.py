"""
Tests package for the API Integration Platform.

This package will contain all unit and integration tests for the platform components.

Subdirectories can be created for organizing tests by module or feature,
for example:
- tests/core/
- tests/nodes/
- tests/workflows/
- tests/utils/
- tests/dashboard/

Test files should typically start with `test_` (e.g., `test_workflow_engine.py`).
